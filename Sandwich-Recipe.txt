What you'll need:
1 jar of creamy peanut butter.
1 bottle/jar of honey.
1 loaf of bread (rye-pumpernickel swirl preferred)
1 butter knife

For best results, pre-read all directions before proceeding.

Step 1:
Pre-heat oven to 425-degrees Fahrenheit. Proceed quickly to step 2.

Step 2:
Turn the oven off as quickly as possible, to save on energy costs and
avoid fires. You will not be needing the oven for the remainder of this
recipe.

Step 3:
Opening the sleeve that contains the bread, withdraw 4-6 slices. Place
slices on clean countertop or cutting board, in an array of 2x2/2x3,
respectively.

Step 4:
Opening the jar of peanut butter, inhale deeply. In the event of other
people nearby, maintain steady eye contact until they leave you to
your sandwich-making.

Step 5:
Using the butter knife's flat edge, scoop a mound of peanut butter on to
one slice for every sandwich you intend to make, leaving the opposite
slice blank for now.

Step 6:
Again using the butter knife's flat edge, spread each mound evenly over
one broad side of the slice of bread on which it rests. For best results,
attempt an even coating of that side, leaving minimal bread visible.

Step 7:
Open jar/bottle of honey. If you are using a squeeze-bottle, tip the
bottle up and drizzle honey onto a blank slice for each sandwich you
intend to make. For best results, draw zig-zag patterns or smiley-faces.
If you are using a jar, you will also need a spoon for this step. Dip the
spoon into the jar, then use it (the spoon) as an implement to complete
the aforementioned drizzling.

Step 8:
For each sandwich, flip the peanut butter slice over onto its corresponding
honey-drizzled slice, with the peanut butter side facing downward.

Step 9:
Eat the sandwiches. If honey drips out and coats everything, you can clean
it later, using hot water, towels, and soap. For now, your only concern is
giving yourself completely to decadence.
